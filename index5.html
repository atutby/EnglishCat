		<ul>
			<li>Welcome to English in Minute!</li>
			<li>The word "volume" has many meanings. It can refer to a book or set of books in a series. That definition may help us with this expression: </li>
			<li>Speak Volumes.</li>
			<li>Did you see Rob earlier today?</li>
			<li>He did not look well after the meeting with the boss.</li>
			<li>I know. He wouldn't tell me what happened but the look on his face spoke volumes.</li>
			<li>He was not happy.</li>
			<li>To "speak volumes" means to provide a lot of information in an indirect way -- and often without words.</li>
			<li>A facial expression, a tone of voice or some other display can "speak volumes."</li>
			<li>Word experts say this expression does indeed come from volumes of books.</li>
			<li>And that's English in a Minute!</li>

				<li>Part5</li>
				<li>Welcome to English in a Minute!</li>
				<li>Social means you like to be around people. A butterfly is an insect.</li>
				<li>SOCIAL BUTTERFLY</li>
				<li>So a social butterfly must be an insect that likes to fly around people?</li>
				<li>So I went to a party last weekend and guess who was there? Jane from accounting.</li>
				<li>Let me guess. She sat in a corner the whole time and didn't talk to anyone... like she does at work.</li>
				<li>No, just the opposite! She was quite the social butterfly -- moving from one person to the next, laughing
					and talking all night long!</li>
				<li>A social butterfly moves among people at a gathering easily, like a butterfly flying from flower to flower.
					A social butterfly enjoys interacting with people.</li>
				<li>And that's English in a Minute.</li>
