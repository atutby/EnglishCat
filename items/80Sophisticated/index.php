        Welcome to the voice of America's News Words.

        In March, Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter were poisoned
        by a dangerous chemical in a small town in Britain.
      </p>
      <p>EXPULSION.</p>
      <p>Britain's Prime Minister said Russia was behind the attacks.</p>
      <p>
        Britain and more than 20 countries said Russian diplomats must leave.
      </p>
      <p>This will be the single biggest expulsion for over 30 years.</p>
      <p>
        Russian president Vladimir Putin denies the charges and ordered the
        expulsion of some foreign diplomats from Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
        Expulsion is the act of forcing someone to leave a place, such as a
        country or a school.
      </p>
      <p>Expulsion is a severe measure, often meant as a punishment.</p>
