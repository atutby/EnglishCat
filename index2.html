      <ul>
        <li>Welcome the Voice of America's News Words.</li>
        <li>Journalist and Saudi government critic Jamal Khashoggi was killed at a Saudi consulate in Turkey in early October.</li>
        <li>CULPABLE</li>
        <li>Khashoggi went to the consulate to get documents needed for his planned marriage. Weeks later, Saudi Arabia admitted he was killed inside the building. It said that 18 people were arrested in connection with a plot to kill him. Turkey says people close to the Saudi leadership are culpable for his death.</li>
        <li>If a person or group is culpable of an action, they are responsible for it.</li>
        <li>Culpable also means being guilty of doing something wrong.</li>

        <li>For centuries, Kayan women in Myanmar have worn a traditional symbol of beauty. </li>
        <li>SHUN </li>
        <li>83-year old Maria Khaing has been wearing rings around her neck, arms and legs since childhood. All Kayan women were once expected to wear them but now, some have started to shun the practice.</li>
        <li>They're heavy and uncomfortable. Also, I don't know much about them. That's why I don't wear them.</li>
        <li>To shun is to ignore, avoid or reject a person, place or activity.</li> 
        <li>People are shunned when their behavior or beliefs are not acceptable to others.</li>

      >
      <ul>
        <li>Welcome to English in a Minute.</li>
        <li>
          Planting seeds is one of the very first steps in starting a garden. So
          do Anna and Jonathan have gardening tips for us?
        </li>
        <li>Hey! You're leaving early.</li>
        <li>Yes, I am. I have to make it to my Portuguese class by 5.</li>
        <li>Since when do you study Portuguese?</li>
        <li>
          Since you showed me all those great pictures from your trip to Brazil.
          That planted a seed, Jonathan. Seed. Deep.
        </li>
        <li>
          To plant a seed means to put something like an idea or feeling - in
          someone's mind. It can be a positive thing like giving Anna the idea
          to go to Brazil. Or it can be a negative thing - like introducing a
          feeling of suspicion or doubt.

        <li>Welcome to English in a Minute.</li>
        <li>
          This week's expression sounds unpleasant. And also dangerous. I'm a
          little worried about Anna and Jonathan.
        </li>
        <li>Hey, Anna! Will I see you at Fred's graduation party tonight?</li>
        <li>
          Nope. Can't make it. My deadline for the teacher training video got
          moved to tomorrow instead of next week.
        </li>
        <li>Wow! Sounds like you're really under the gun. Need help?</li>
        <li>Yes! Here. Can you edit these by 5?</li>
        <li>Uh... Ok. Now I'm under the gun.</li>
        <li>No, Jonathan. We're under the gun.</li>
        <li>
          If you are "under the gun." you feel stressed out and under pressure.
          You might feel this way when you have a big project at school, a
          deadline at work, or when you have to make a difficult decision by a
          given time. And that's English in a minute.

          <li>Oh, it's going great! Your cousin Keith has been a huge help.</li>
          <li>
            I'm so glad he's taken you under his wing. You know, in our family,

          <li>Well. He sure is the coffee king.</li>

            If you "take someone under your wing," you help and guide them. You
            make sure they have what they need. You are a little like their
            protector. You might do this for someone. Who is new to a job or
            school, or for someone who is new to a profession that you have
            experience with.

          <li>Welcome to English in a Minute.</li>
          <li>
            Sometimes we cut with a knife, sometimes with scissors. But what do
            you use to cut slack? Let's find out.
          </li>
          <li>Where's Jane?</li>
          <li>She's not here yet.</li>
          <li>
            She's late ... again! And now (the do) I have to do | the whole show
            by myself ... again!
          </li>
          <li>
            Jonathan, calm down. Jane has had a lot of problems lately with her
            family. Let's cut her some slack.
          </li>
          <li>She is a paid professional. So, no! No slack will be cut.</li>
          <li>
            When you "cut someone some slack," you are more forgiving of their
            actions than you normally would be. The word slack, in this case,
            means the part of a line or a rope that hangs loosely instead of
            being tight.

            Every language has weather-related expressions. Two common weather
            conditions are rainy and sunny.
          </li>
          <li>
            Jonathan, are you comming to my Lawn Cary party? We need to mow the
            lawn, pull the weeds, and cut down a dead tree.
          </li>
          <li>Of course! I will be there.</li>
          <li>
            You know, you also said you were comming to my Paint My Kitchen
            party and you didn't.
          </li>
          <li>
            This time I will. Come rain or shine. I will be at your place
            Saturday morning!
          </li>
          <li>
            Come rain or shine means something will happen no matter what. It's
            a promise. You can even use the phrase when talking about the actual
            weather. So, if you invite people to an outdoor party, you can tell
            them it will happen, come rain or shine.

          <li>Jonathan, I don't know which notebook to use.</li>
          <li>It's a note book. What's the difference?</li>
          <li>
            Huge defferences! This one has lines. This one does not. This one
            has a spiral binder. This one does not.
          </li>
          <li>Okay, now you're just spliting hairs.</li>
          <li>
            When you "split hairs," you focus on really small and unimportant
            defferences between two or more things. This is a useful expression
            during an argument. If you are arguing with someone over something
            very small, you can say, "Let's not split hairs. It's not worth it."

            Many expressions in American English have to do with animals, like
            this one.

            Hey Jonathan, did you get a chance to go to that new restaurant by
            your apartment?
          </li>
          <li>Oh yeah!</li>
          <li>I pigged out.</li>
          <li>I tried almost every single dish they had.</li>
          <li>The food was that good, huh?</li>
          <li>Sure was.</li>
          <li>
            But next time I decide to try a new restaurant, please remind me to
            not pig out | quite that much!
          </li>
          <li>
            When we say "pig out" about a person, it means that person seems to
            eat as much as a pig does
          </li>
          <li>
            To "pig out" means to eat a lot of something all at once, probably
            more than you should!
