          Journalist and Saudi government critic Jamal Kashoggi was killid at a
          Saudi consulate in Turkey in early October.
        </li>
        <li>CULPABLE</li>
        <li>
          Khashoggi went to the consulate to get documents needed for his
          planned marriage. Weeks later, Saudi Arabia admitted he was killed
          inside the building. It said that 18 people were arrested in
          connection with a plot to kill him. Turkey says people close to the
          Saudi leadership are culpable for his death.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a person or group is culpable of an action, they are responsible
          for it.
        </li>
        <li>Culpable also means being guilty of doing something wrong.</li>

        <li>SHUN</li>
        <li>
          83-year old Maria Khaing has been wearing rings around her neck, arms
          and legs since childhood. All Kayan women were once expected to wear
          them but now, some have started to shun the practice.

          They're heavy and uncomfortable. Also, I don't know much about them.
          That's why I don't wear them.
        </li>
        <li>
          To shun is to ignore, avoid or reject a person, place or activity.
