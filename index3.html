      <li>You already know that firefighters are trained to safely put out fires.</li>
      <li>Put Out Fires.</li>
      <li>Do Anna and Jonathan have new careers?</li>
      <li>Anna! I haven't seen you all week. What have you been doing?</li>
      <li>I have been busy putting out fires! First, Kim yelled at a very important customer, and then Kevin! Kevin gave the wrong presentation at a big meeting.</li>
      <li>So now is not a good time to tell you that there's a big mistake in this report...?</li>
      <li>As an idiom, to "put out fires" means to deal with urgent problems rather than your usual tasks.</li>
      <li>Think of the problem as a fire -- something that needs to be dealt with quickly before it spreads or causes much damage.</li>
      <li>And that's English in a Minute!</li>

      <li>How was the Bee Lovers Association meeting?</li>
      <li>It was great! We talked about how to feed bees in the winter, which flowers to plant in the spring, how to protect bees from other animals, and other things.</li>
      <li>You sure covered a lot of ground in one meeting.</li>
      <li>We did ... just like a bee!</li>
      <li>Yes, Anna. Just like a bee.</li>
      <li>English speakers use the expression "to cover a lot of ground" in two ways.</li>
      <li>One means to travel a great distance.</li>
      <li>We heard the other definition in our example to deal with or talk about a large amount of information.</li>

			<li>
				In September, The New York Times newspaper published an opinion
				criticizing U.S. President Donald Trump.
			</li>
			<li>ANONYMOUS</li>
			<li>
				The anonymous opinion was written by a senior official in Trump's
				government.
			</li>
			<li>
				"When you tell me about some anonymous source within the
				administration, probably who's failing and probably here for all the
				wrong reasons..."
			</li>
			<li>
				Someone who is anonymous is not identified by name. This opinion was
				unusual because major newspapers in the U.S. usually require writers
				to sign their work.
			</li>
			<li>
				When an author does not want to be known, publishers call him or her
				"anonymous."
