        <li>Welcome to the Voice of America's News Words.</li>
        <li>
          In September, The New York Times newspaper published an opinion
          criticizing U.S. President Donald Trump.
        </li>
        <li>ANONYMOUS</li>
        <li>
          The anonymous opinion was written by a senior official in Trump's
          government.
        </li>
        <li>
          "When you tell me about some anonymous source within the
          administration, probably who's failing and probably here for all the
          wrong reasons..."
        </li>
        <li>
          Someone who is anonymous is not identified by name. This opinion was
          unusual because major newspapers in the U.S. usually require writers
          to sign their work.
        </li>
        <li>
          When an author does not want to be known, publishers call him or her
          "anonymous."

        <li>The Baobab is a well-known tree in Africa.</li>
        <li>SUPERFOOD</li>
        <li>
          Inside the green shell that comes from the tree is a tasty fruit. For
          farmers in Senegal, the business of selling fruit from the baobab tree
          has increased in the last year. The fruit has become a popular
          superfood in the United States and Europe.
        </li>
        <li>
          A superfood is something to eat that has a lot of nutrients and
          vitamins. Superfoods improve health and well-being.
        </li>
        <li>
          They include salmon, sardines, spinach, broccoli, baobab and
          blueberries.
        </li>
        <li>Now you know what superfood means.</li>

          Washing your hands is one of the easiest ways to stop the spread of
          disease.
        </li>
        <li>INCUBATOR</li>
        <li>
          Two women created a fun way for children to wash their hands. It is a
          cleaner drawn on the skin and removed by washing. The women did not
          have much business experience, so they turned to a business incubator
          for help in selling the product.
        </li>
        <li>
          A business incubator is an organization that helps young companies
          grow and develop. It offers training, technical support, and other
          services.
        </li>
        <li>
          More commonly, an incubator is a device that keeps eggs or even new
          babies warm.
