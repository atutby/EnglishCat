          Journalist and Saudi government critic Jamal Kashoggi was killid at a
          Saudi consulate in Turkey in early October.

        <li>
          Khashoggi went to the consulate to get documents needed for his
          planned marriage. Weeks later, Saudi Arabia admitted he was killed
          inside the building. It said that 18 people were arrested in
          connection with a plot to kill him. Turkey says people close to the
          Saudi leadership are culpable for his death.

          If a person or group is culpable of an action, they are responsible
          for it.
        </li>
        <li>Culpable also means being guilty of doing something wrong.</li>
