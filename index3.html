				<li>Welcome to the Voice of America's News Words.</li>
        <li>Last spring, as immigrant families arrived at the U.S. southern border, officials separated children from their parents.</li>
        <li>VULNERABLE</li>
        <li>The Trump administration's policy called for the arrest of migrants who came into the U.S. illegally. Families were separated during legal proceedings. Doctors say young children are the most vulnerable to health problems from family separations.</li>
        <li>If people are vulnerable, they can be easily hurt physically, mentally or emotionally.</li>
        <li>Things like wounds or places are vulnerable when they are open to harm, attack or damage.</li>

        <li>STIGMA</li>
        <li>In the early 1990s, thousands of bicycles were given to Cubans after the fall of the Soviet Union. It was a time of economic hardship. Now, dozens of cyclists ride 20 kilometers through Havana once a month. The idea is to lose the stigma that bicycles still have with many Cubans.</li>

        <li>Welcome to the Voice of America's News Words.</li>
        <li>
          The World Bank says migrant workers in the United States have
          increased the amount of money they send home.
        </li>
        <li>REMITTANCE</li>
        <li>
          Last year, $466 billion in remittances flowed to low and middle-income
          countries. That figure is estimated to grow to $485 billion this year.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remittances are a lifeline to many countries that are facing some sort
          of a crisis. The poorer the country, the larger their dependence on
          remittances.
        </li>
        <li>
          A remittance is money sent, usually by mail, as a payment or as a
          gift.
        </li>
        <li>
          Here, it is money that migrants earn in one country, and then send to
          their families in their home countries.

          In Uganda, officials have placed thousands of cameras throughout the
          country.
        </li>
        <li>FORFEIT</li>
        <li>
          Police use the cameras to look for possible criminal activity in
          public areas. Critics say they are an unlawful way to monitor
          Ugandans' daily lives. Lawyer Galisonga Julius says people need to
          forfeit privacy for public safety
        </li>
        <li>
          To forfeit is to give away the right to something. A forfeit can be a
          punishment or an exchange for something else.
        </li>
        <li>
          In sports, a team that does not follow the rules may have to forfeit -

        <li>Welcome to the Voice of America's News Words.</li>
        <li>
          In September, The New York Times newspaper published an opinion
          criticizing U.S. President Donald Trump.
        </li>
        <li>ANONYMOUS</li>
        <li>
          The anonymous opinion was written by a senior official in Trump's
          government.
        </li>
        <li>
          "When you tell me about some anonymous source within the
          administration, probably who's failing and probably here for all the
          wrong reasons..."
        </li>
        <li>
          Someone who is anonymous is not identified by name. This opinion was
          unusual because major newspapers in the U.S. usually require writers
          to sign their work.
        </li>
        <li>
          When an author does not want to be known, publishers call him or her
          "anonymous."

        <li>
          Two women created a fun way for children to wash their hands. It is a
          cleaner drawn on the skin and removed by washing. The women did not
          have much business experience, so they turned to a business incubator
          for help in selling the product.

        <li>
          A business incubator is an organization that helps young companies
