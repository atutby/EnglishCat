		<li>Not well. She's still pretty upset about her breakup. These days, I stay out of her way. I am very quiet. I

		<li>Wow. Talk about walking on eggshells.</li>
		<li>Seriously. It seems like no matter what I say, she starts crying.</li>
		<li>An eggshell is delicate. And so is a situation where you must walk on them.</li>
		<li>You try hard not to anger or upset someone.</li>
		<li>You have to think about what to say and how to act.</li>
